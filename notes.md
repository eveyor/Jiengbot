# First attempt at putting it together
- the GPT did not recognise any of my diatrics in my csv file, it  can not preserve UTF-8 encoding and completely ignores my data 
- I have to use txt files only, but even then at times it pulls incorrect data from elsewhere
- the GPT can successfully recall and match the small data set I give it after giving clear instructions
