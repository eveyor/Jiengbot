import random

## I need to import my datasets so that I have something to generate coherent sentences from
from datasets import verbs
from datasets import pronouns
from datasets import possessive_pronouns

## I need to make my function
def main ()

## I will implement a code that is supposed to make it easier to locate the specific words in my dataset

##I am going to utilise a simple function that utilises Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate a sentence in Dinka language.
