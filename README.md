# Dinka dataset and translator for my regional dialect, utilised with AI and NLP resources
This project of mine is an ongoing and educational initiative which I have taken to preserve my language as we develop, my dialect focuses on Aweil as there is a lack of resources for those wanting to learn this dialect.
Goals:
1. Utilising AI and NLP to preserve and teach a low resource language
2. train the AI to become fluent and teach others
3. incorporate other regional dialects which may have some words that vary but overall function the same
### Categories currently available
***Note some placeholders have been put in place for certain letters that I cannot copy at the moment, such as old Latin characters,
1. I will develop a pronounciation key and hopefully be able to implement more advanced features such as voice in the future.
2. Gathering Data has been difficult as there is not a lot of resources available in this language, however I have thankfully acquired three books to work off
3. A current translator for Jieng exists on google translate, however it is innacurate and does not account for regional dialect so it is unusable for my dialect
