# Dinka dataset and translator with NLP resources
This project of mine is an ongoing and educational initiative which I have taken to preserve my language as we develop, my dialect focuses on Aweil as there is a lack of resources for those wanting to learn this dialect.

Goals:
1. Utilising AI and NLP in the near future to preserve and teach a low resource language (Dinka/Jieng)
2. Ideally train the AI to become fluent in Jieng and teach others
3. incorporate other regional dialects which may have some words that vary but overall function the same
### Current State: 
- some placeholders have been put in place for certain letters that I cannot copy at the moment, such as old Latin characters,
1. I will develop a pronounciation key and hopefully be able to implement more advanced features such as voice in the future.
2. Gathering Data has been difficult as there is not a lot of resources available in this language, however I have thankfully acquired three books to work off
3. A current translator for Jieng exists on google translate, however it is innacurate and does not account for regional dialect so it is unusable for my dialect
4. The AI and neural network stage will be a key component and will be established once enough data is available to work on
5. The main challenge is the difficulty of available keyboard for characters. I have identified one currently available Jieng keyboard via Keyman
