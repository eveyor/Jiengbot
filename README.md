# Dinka dataset and translator for my regional dialect, utilised with AI and NLP resources
This project of mine is a personal and educational initiative which I have taken to preserve my culture as we develop our language, my dialect focuses on Aweil and Bor as there is a lack of resources for those wanting to learn this dialect.
Goals:
1. Utilising Ai and NLP to preserve and teach a low resource languages
2. train the AI to become fluent and teach others
3. incorporate other regional dialects which may have some words that vary but overall function the same

### Categories currently available
***Note some placeholders have been put in place for certain letters that I cannot copy at the moment, such as old Latin characters
i will deveop a pronounciation key and hopefully be able to implement voice features in the future
